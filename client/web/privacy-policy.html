      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: May 13, 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Database Diagrams (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy
        explains how we (Fractal Fable Solutions, "us", "we", or "our") collect,
        use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our web
        application accessible at diagrams.fractalfable.com. Please read this
        privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this
        privacy policy, please do not access the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to protecting your personal data and respecting your
        privacy in compliance with applicable data protection laws, including
        the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) if you are a resident of
        the European Economic Area (EEA).
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data Controller</h2>
      <p>
        For the purpose of the GDPR, the data controller is Fractal Fable
        Solutions, 123 Tech Avenue, Innovation City, CA 90210, USA. You can
        contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@diagrams.fractalfable.com.
      </p>

      <h2>3. What Personal Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>We may collect the following types of personal data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register for an
          account, we collect your username and a hashed version of your
          password. We do not store your password in plain text.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diagram Data (User Content):</strong> We collect the diagrams
          you create, including their names, types (e.g., PostgreSQL, Firestore,
          Custom), and the content of the diagrams (which may include entity
          names, attributes, relationships, and other schema details you input).
          While the Service is not intended for storing sensitive personal data
          within diagram content, you are responsible for the data you include
          in your diagrams.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sharing Information:</strong> If you use features to share
          diagrams, we store information about who you share diagrams with (by
          their username or user ID within our system) and their permission
          levels.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect information on how the
          Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may
          include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address
          (e.g., IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our
          Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time
          spent on those pages, and general interaction patterns. We use this
          data in an aggregated and anonymized form where possible for service
          improvement and monitoring. We do not currently use third-party
          analytics tools that track individual users across sites.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. How We Use Your Personal Data</h2>
      <p>We use your personal data for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain our Service.</li>
        <li>To manage your account and provide you with customer support.</li>
        <li>
          To allow you to create, store, manage, and share your database
          diagrams.
        </li>
        <li>
          To communicate with you, for example, responding to your inquiries or
          sending essential service-related announcements (e.g., maintenance
          notifications, security alerts).
        </li>
        <li>
          To monitor the usage of our Service and improve its functionality and
          user experience.
        </li>
        <li>To enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Legal Basis for Processing (for EEA Residents)</h2>
      <p>
        If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for
        collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy
        Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context
        in which we collect it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent:</strong> We process your account information based on
          your consent provided during registration when you agree to our Terms
          of Service and this Privacy Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> Processing your diagram
          data and sharing information is necessary for the performance of the
          service contract with you (to provide the diagramming tool as
          described in our Terms of Service).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legitimate Interests:</strong> We may process some data (like
          aggregated Usage Data) based on our legitimate interests, such as for
          improving our Service, for security purposes, and for operational
          monitoring, provided that such processing shall not override your
          rights and freedoms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may process your data to comply
          with legal obligations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. We may share your personal data in
        the following limited circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use third-party hosting
          services (e.g., a Virtual Private Server provider) to host our
          application and database. These providers only process data on our
          behalf as necessary to provide the hosting infrastructure and are
          contractually obligated to maintain its confidentiality and security.
          We do not share personal data with them beyond what is necessary for
          hosting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your personal
          data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by
          public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Protection of Rights:</strong> We may disclose your
          information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent,
          or take action regarding potential violations of our policies,
          suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety
          of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in
          which we are involved.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We will retain your personal data only for as long as is necessary for
        the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your
        personal data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal
        obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to
        comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal
        agreements and policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Account information and diagram data will be retained as long as your
        account is active. If you delete your account, your personal data,
        including your diagrams, will be permanently deleted from our active
        systems within 30 days, and from backups within 90 days, unless
        retention is required for legal reasons.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Your Data Protection Rights (GDPR)</h2>
      <p>
        If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have
        certain data protection rights. We aim to take reasonable steps to allow

      </p>

        <li>

          withdraw your consent at any time where we relied on your consent to

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The right to lodge a complaint:</strong> You have the right to
          lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in your member state of

      <h2>9. How to Exercise Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at
        privacy@diagrams.fractalfable.com. We may need to verify your identity
        before responding to such requests. We will respond to your request
        within one month.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can request account deletion by contacting us at the email address

        account settings in the future.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help
        protect your personal information. This includes using HTTPS for data
        transmission, hashing passwords using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt),
        and regular security practices for our server infrastructure. While we
        have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you
        provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security
        measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission
        can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        We use essential cookies solely for the purpose of managing user
        sessions and ensuring the basic functionality of the Service (e.g.,
        keeping you logged in). These cookies do not track your activity across
        other websites and do not store personal information beyond what is
        necessary for session management. We do not currently use cookies for
        analytics, advertising, or other non-essential tracking purposes. You
        can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a
        cookie is being sent, but if you do not accept essential cookies, you
        may not be able to use some portions of our Service.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 16. We
        do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
        children under 16. If you become aware that a child has provided us with
        Personal Data without parental consent, please contact us. If we become
        aware that we have collected Personal Data from children under 16
        without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that
        information from our servers.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you
        of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and
        updating the "Last updated" date. If the changes are significant, we may
        also provide a more prominent notice (such as an email notification or a
        notice within the Service). You are advised to review this Privacy
        Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are
        effective when they are posted on this page.
      </p>
